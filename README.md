# BlizzardAPI_MountCheck
Just a small Node-App which Checks the Auction-Data of every EU-Realm for one of the rare-TCG-WoW-Mounts.
If a Mount is found in an Auction it will say which Connected-Realms it's up on.

For Setup, pls insert your client_id and client_secret at line 5&6 in index.js.
The link for the API-Signup is here:  https://develop.battle.net/access/clients
